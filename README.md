## 📚 Algorithm Portfolio with Real-World Examples

| Algorithm                             | Why It’s Important                                                             | Real-Life Example                                                  |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Bubble Sort**                       | Simple to understand; great for learning basic sorting logic.                  | Sorting a small classroom list by grade.                           |
| **Insertion Sort**                    | Efficient for nearly sorted data; adaptive with minimal overhead.              | Tidying up a nearly sorted playlist or to-do list.                 |
| **Selection Sort**                    | Predictable performance; useful in low-memory environments.                    | Choosing the fastest HR candidate from a small pool.               |
| **Counting Sort**                     | Excellent for integers within a known range; linear time complexity.           | Tallying scores for students when the maximum score is clear.      |
| **Merge Sort**                        | Stable and efficient; excellent for large datasets with guaranteed O(n log n). | Sorting a large user database or file listings.                    |
| **Quick Sort**                        | Typically fast in practice; widely used in standard libraries.                 | Organizing search results or lists quickly.                        |
| **Knapsack (0/1 & Fractional)**       | Helps master dynamic programming and greedy strategies.                        | Planning cargo load or budget allocation in shipping/logistics.    |
| **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)**  | Fundamental for sequence alignment tasks.                                      | Comparing DNA strands in bioinformatics or versioning systems.     |
| **Matrix Chain Multiplication (MCM)** | Optimizes computation order—crucial for efficiency.                            | Optimizing chained database query execution or graphics rendering. |
| **Graph Traversals (BFS & DFS)**      | Essential for structure exploration, pathfinding, and component analysis.      | Mapping social networks or traversing file systems.                |
